> This feature is currently in beta and may change based on feedback that we receive.

Gives access to the ThirdwebSDK instance and other useful hooks to the rest of the app. Requires to be wrapped with a ConnectionProvider and a WalletProvider from @solana/wallet-adapter-react.

## Example

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react/solana";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider network="devnet">
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
ThirdwebProvider: React.FC<PropsWithChildren<ThirdwebProviderProps>>;
```
