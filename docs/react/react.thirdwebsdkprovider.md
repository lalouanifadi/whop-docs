## ThirdwebSDKProvider variable

A basic wrapper around the Thirdweb SDK.

You can use this in order to be able to pass a provider &amp; signer directly to the SDK.

**Signature:**

```typescript
ThirdwebSDKProvider: ComponentWithChildren<ThirdwebSDKProviderProps>;
```

## Remarks

Utilizing this provider will mean hooks for wallet management are not available, if you need those please use the [ThirdwebProvider](./react.thirdwebprovider.md) instead.
