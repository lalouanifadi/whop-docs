# Integrate via Webhooks

Follow this guide to easily integrate with Whop's membership platform using webhooks.

If you aren't familiar, [Webhooks](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/guides/what-are-webhooks-how-they-work#what-is-a-webhook) are a widely popular form of communication between web servers. Instead of having to constantly refetch data from an API, your server will be sent updates (aka webhooks) whenever an event happens on the providers end.

We send webhooks when key events happen for your company and users. These events are useful for knowing when a User has purchased your product and when they should be granted access to your software. We also send an event when the User should no longer have access.

Thus, your application is simply responsible for accepting incoming requests from Whop and processing them as you see fit.

### Configure your Webhook URL

The Whop Business dashboard has a dedicated [developer settings page](https://dash.whop.com/developer), where you'll be able to access, update, and manage all things related to Whop API. This is where you'll begin configuring your webhook endpoint URL.

### Test your Endpoint

Enter your correct route into the modal and click the **Send test webhook** button. Our server will attempt to `POST` an example webhook event to the endpoint your provided. If your application accepts the request and returns a 200 HTTP response code, you'll see a green message saying "Test successful". Now, your endpoint will begin receiving events.

Here is an abbreviated example of the payload that would have been sent to your server:

```
{
  "action": "membership.went_valid",
  "data": {
    "id": "mem_DWWmfqMNSk5TVF",
    "created_at": "2022-12-05 02:28:57 +0200",
    "access_pass": {
        ...
    },
    "user": {
        ...
    },
    "plan": {
        ...
    },
    "status": "active",
    "license_key": "DEMO-508ED6-8D5E4B16-2A409FW",
    "metadata": {},
    "valid": true,
    "quantity": 1,
    "renewal_period_start": "2022-12-05 02:28:57 +0200",
    "renewal_period_end": "2023-01-04 02:28:57 +0200",
    "wallet_address": null,
    "custom_fields_responses": {},
    "discord": null,
    "email": "email603180@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

### Handling Events

Once you start receiving events, the next step is to make use of them so that you can deliver access of your product to the User who just purchased. Here is an example database you can build:

- Make a `Users` table
  - Store the `user.id` and the `user.email` from the event payload
- Make a `Subscriptions` table
  - Store the `Membership` `id` from the event payload
  - Store the `valid` boolean from the event payload
  - Attach it to the user you just made

For a complete guide on the specific events we send, as well as some other technical details, visit the [Webhooks page](/webhooks/).

### Post purchase experience

On the [passes page](https://dash.whop.com/passes/), you'll want to configure your post purchase welcome message to include instructions on how your buyer can claim their account and/or access your application. It might be helpful to include a link to your login or FAQ.

### Test your Integration

Once your business logic is ready, you'll want to test your integration to make sure events are handled properly and your users will experience the desired flow. Using the free `Plan` you made earlier, you can purchase a free `Membership` to your company, and wait for the `membership.went_valid` to be sent to your server. Similarly, if you want to test the `membership.went_invalid` event, you can terminate the free `Membership` you just purchased by navigating to the [members](https://dash.whop.com/members) page and opening your `User`'s profile.

### Continue setup

Now that your developer integration is ready, you'll want to continue configuring your dashboard by setting up your `AccessPasses`, `Plans`, and `Experiences` before you launch. Click [here](/getting-started/sell-access#finish-setup) to continue our step-by-step guide.
