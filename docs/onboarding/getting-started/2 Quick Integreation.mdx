# Quick Integration

Follow this guide to easily integrate with Whop's membership platform using webhooks.

1. [Go to your dashboard](https://google.com) and set up your webhooks. Input the URL and send a test webhook for confirmation.

2. Once it's set up, we'll send a webhook to you whenever a membership is created. The webhook will include relevant user information, allowing you to customize your experience.

3. We'll also send you a webhook when a membership is no longer valid.
