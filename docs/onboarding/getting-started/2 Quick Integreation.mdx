# Quick Integration

Follow this guide to easily integrate with Whop's membership platform using webhooks.

If you aren't familiar, [Webhooks](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/guides/what-are-webhooks-how-they-work#what-is-a-webhook) are a widely popular form of communication between web servers. Instead of having to constantly refetch data from an API, a destination server will be sent updates (aka webhooks) whenever an event happens on the providers end.

An event can represent many things, most notably when a resource is either updated or created. A few examples include: when a **Membership** is purchased, a **Membership** is canceled, or a new **Payment** is received.

Then, a developer's application is simply responsible for accepting incoming requests from the provider and processing them as they see fit.


# Guide

1. Setup your company at [dash.whop.com](https://dash.whop.com/). It's completely free to sign-up and only takes a few clicks. You'll choose a name, add your branding, and configure the details for your company.

2. Getting ready test. It'll be easiest to create a free plan that you can purchase as a test. Click the **Add pricing option** button on the right side of the [home screen](https://dash.whop.com/home?welcome=true), and click on the **Free to join** option to properly setup the plan. Before you save, head to the **Visibility** tab to make the plan hidden so only you can access it while testing.

3. Configure your webhook url. The Whop Business dashboard has a dedicated [developer settings page](https://dash.whop.com/developer), where you'll be able to access, update, and manage all things related to Whop API. This is where you'll begin configuring your webhook endpoint URL.

4. Test your endpoint. Enter your correct route into the modal and click the **Send test webhook** button. Our server will attempt to `POST` an example webhook event to the endpoint your provided. If your application accepts the request and returns a 200 HTTP response code, you'll see a green message saying "Test successful". Now, your endpoint will begin receiving events.

5. Simulate an event. Now that your endpoint is configured, you'll want to test your integration to make sure events are handled properly by your application. Using the free plan you made earlier, you can purchase a free Membership to your company, and wait for the `membership.went_valid` to be sent to your server. Similarly, if you want to test the `membership.went_invalid` event, you can terminate the free membership you just purchased by navigating to the [Members](https://dash.whop.com/members) page and opening your user's profile.

6. Setup complete. You are now configured to listen for events from your Whop Business dashboard. If you'd like to learn more about the different types of events you can receive and their respective payloads, head to our [Webhooks guide](/webhooks).


# Example Setup

While you can interpret and process these webhooks events however you see fit, there are a few tips we'd like to provide that can get you started in the right direction.


When you receive the `membership.went_valid` event, this means that someone has either just purchased a Membership for your application, or they successfully reactivated a Membership that was expired.
Therefore, you'll want to make sure that the user this event is related either has their access added into your application, or their access is restored. In this instance, the `valid` boolean will be `true`.


When you receive the `membership.went_invalid` event, this means that someone's Membership has been canceled or has expired. This Membership's user no longer pays for your app or service, and consequently should have their access revoked.
In this instance, the `valid` boolean will be `false`.
