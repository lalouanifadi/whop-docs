## Finish Setup

After you've completed your developer integration, you'll want to head back to the [dashboard](https://dash.whop.com/home) to configure your product page, pricing options, and payment methods.
We strongly encourage you check out our [non-technical user guides](https://docs.whop.com/biz-2.0/walkthrough/overview) that will explain everything the dashboard has to offer to help you manage and grow your business.
