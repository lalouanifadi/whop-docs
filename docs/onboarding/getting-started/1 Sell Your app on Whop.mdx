# Get Started

In this getting started guide, we'll show you how to build and deploy a webapp that you can charge users to access.

If you prefer, you can fork our template NextJS app [Github](https://github.com/whopio/whop-courses/tree/template/app) (coming soon) to explore sample code directly.

### Get your API Keys

In order to find your oauth keys, you need to go to your [Whop Dashboard](https://dash.whop.com). After you find your API keys, continue reading this document below.
