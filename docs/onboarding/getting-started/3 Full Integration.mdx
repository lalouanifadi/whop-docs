Integrating with Whop and the Whop API is easy. If you're a developer with a business account on [our dashboard](https://dash.whop.com), follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Choosing Your Authentication Method(s)

Navigate to your [Whop Developer settings](https://dash.whop.com/developer) retrieve your API key or OAuth2 credentials. Not sure which method to use?

- Whop OAuth allows users to authenticate themselves through Whop, and allows you to make API requests **client-side** on behalf of them. This is important for when you need to ensure the user is really who they say they are.
  Refer to the [OAuth2 Implementation guide](/authentication/oauth) for a more in-depth explanation on using OAuth.

- For any kind of logic you want to do **server-side**, authentication with API keys is the way to go. This means if you are using Whop OAuth, there's a chance you will be using your API key as well.

### 2. Authenticating with OAuth

First, you will need to send your users to the Whop OAuth Portal. The URL might look something like this:

```
https://whop.com/oauth?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
```

Once the user has authenticated themselves on the Whop OAuth Portal, they will be redirected back to the redirect_uri specified. This link will look something like this:

```
https://your_redirect_uri.com/auth/whop/callback?code=RANDOM_AUTH_CODE
```

Once you have this code, you will need to make a `POST` request to `https://data.whop.com/oauth/token` in order to exchange this code (shown in the example as `RANDOM_AUTH_CODE`) for a full authorization token.

### 3. Gating Access to your Software/App

Now that your OAuth implementation is working and users are authenticated, check if a user holds a pass using the `/me/has_access/:id` endpoint. You can find the documentation for this endpoint [here](https://dev.whop.com/reference/has_access).

- Checking for access on a **Company** level (by passing a `biz_*************` ID) will tell you if a user has any valid memberships under the specified company.
- Checking for access on an **Access Pass** level (by passing a `pass_*************` ID) will tell you if a user has any valid memberships under the specified access pass.
- Checking for access on an **Experience** level (by passing an `exp_*************` ID) will tell you if a user has any valid memberships that give access to the specified experience.

Customize the user's experience on your app by pulling in their profile using the various `/me` endpoints and displaying that info on your app. This can include their username, social accounts, profile picture, and other details.

For example, every time a user accesses your app, you might want to retrieve their personalization info from the [Retrieve Profile](https://dev.whop.com/reference/retrieve_profile) endpoint.
Then, check if they still have access to your app (by checking if they hold your **Access Pass** using the [Has Access](https://dev.whop.com/reference/has_access) endpoint).
Now you know the identity of the user, as well as their access level, and can conditionally show them your software/app.

### NextJS Template

- If you don't want to bother with RESTful requests and just want to dive in to some code, our [NextJS Template App](/nextjs) is the perfect solution. 
Built on the latest version of NextJS, this template app is already optimized for integrations with Whop (using our JavaScript and Typescript SDK), letting you focus on what's important to your customers
