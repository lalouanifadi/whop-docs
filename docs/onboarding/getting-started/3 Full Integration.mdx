Integrating with Whop and the Whop API is easy. If you're a developer with a business account on [our dashboard](https://dash.whop.com), follow these steps to get started:

### Authentication

Navigate to your [Whop Developer settings](https://dash.whop.com/developer) retrieve your API key or OAuth2 credentials. Not sure which method to use?

- Whop OAuth allows users to authenticate themselves through Whop, and allows you to make API requests **client-side**. Refer to the [OAuth2 Implementation guide](/authentication/oauth) for a more in-depth explanation on using OAuth.

- If you'd rather do your logic **server-side**, authentication with API keys is the way to go.

### Gating Access with OAuth

Once your OAuth implementation is set up, check if a user holds a pass using the `/me/has_access/:id` endpoint. You can find the documentation for this endpoint [here](https://dev.whop.com/reference/has_access).

Customize the user's experience on your app by pulling in their profile using the various `/me` endpoints and displaying that info on your app. This can include their username, social accounts, profile picture, and other details.

Every time a user accesses your app, check if they still have access by checking if they hold the pass.

### Server-Side Integration

Making any kind of script, software tool, or admin panel is simple with Whop API's server-side endpoints. Using one of our `list` endpoints, such as [List Memberships](https://dev.whop.com/reference/list_memberships),
you can iterate over resources and take action based on logic you implement.
