# IPFS Media Renderer

The IPFS Media Renderer component resolves any IPFS URI that contains a media file (such as an image, video, or audio file)
and renders the relevant component to show that media. This is especially useful for two use cases:

1. Displaying the media assets of NFTs with metadata stored on IPFS
2. Rendering NFTs where you are unsure of the file type (i.e. you don't know if it's an image or video)

## Example

Below is an example of passing in an IPFS URI that points to a video (`.mp4`) file into the `MediaRenderer` component

```jsx
import { MediaRenderer } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <MediaRenderer
      src="ipfs://Qmb9ZV5yznE4C4YvyJe8DVFv1LSVkebdekY6HjLVaKmHZi"
      alt="A mp4 video"
    />
  );
};
```
