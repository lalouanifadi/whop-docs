2. **Payments** with credit card, apple pay, or crypto so you don't have to build any checkout.

## Authentication

<div className="heroGrid">

<div>
  <p>Checking to see if a user has access to use your application is the first step in many projects.</p>

You can use our [OAuth2 flow](https://dev.whop.com/reference/oauth-implementation) to check a user's membership status and require payment if they are not a valid member.

<p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Our OAuth flow:</p>

- Can be integrated **seamlessly** on your website / app
- Handles **many** common login options, including Discord, Google, Apple, and crypto wallet login
- Generates a user token that you can use to get **all** information on the user who is logged in

## Payments

<div className="heroGrid">

<div>
  <p>If a user does not hold a valid membership, they can get one by paying with credit card (including Apple Pay), cryptocurrency, or by proving they own an NFT.</p>

You can use our payments flow to require a user to make a payment or confirm their NFT holdings.

<p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Our payments infrastructure:</p>

- Can be linked to your **existing** Stripe account
- Handles **every** major currency
- Allows you to offer a **branded checkout** experience for your customers
