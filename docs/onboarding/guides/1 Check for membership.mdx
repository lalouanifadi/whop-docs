title: Check for access
slug: /guides/check-for-access
---

While you build your app, you might find that you want to check if a user has access to a certain resource or not. These resources would be either:
- Your company
- A specific access pass
- A specific experience

need active memebrship etc

### IGNORE

Write a guide for an API Docs guides website that tells a user how to check if a user holds an active membership for their company.

A membership is ownership of an access pass. They can use the endpoint `/me/companies/:company_id` to see if they have access

If they do, it will respond with a membership object. If not, it will give a 404

Use code snippets to show how to make a request

Tell them that this is how can they memebership-gate their app to make sure only people who should have access can use it
