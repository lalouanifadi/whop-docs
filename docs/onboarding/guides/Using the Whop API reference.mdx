Are you ready to unlock the full potential of the Whop API?
Whether you're learning to be a developer or an experienced senior engineer, we want your integration to be as smooth as possible.
We've organized our public RESTful API into a grouping of typed resources and the functions/endpoints you can call on each of them.
By looking at the resources and endpoints, you can easily see what actions are available to you as a developer, and begin working on how to implement your ideas.
You can then try out the endpoints in your browser and use the generated code to integrate the API into your app.

### Documentation Structure

When you navigate to the Whop API reference, you will see a list of resources that the API can interact with.
These resources represent the data that you can access or modify through the API, organized in a way to best simplify some of the business logic we handle internally.
For example, if the API allows you to access information about memberships, there will be a "Memberships" resource that you can use.

Within each resource, you will see a list of endpoints. An endpoint represents a specific action that you can perform on a resource.
For example, you might see endpoints for getting a list of memberships, getting a specific membership, updating an existing membership, and so on.

### Testing Endpoints

To best understand and test the implementation of our endpoints, navigate to the page on the Whop API reference.

<p style={{ marginBottom: 6 }}>Each endpoint will include:</p>

- a description of the endpoint, including any important context or hints
- the parameters/variables you can pass to it (including the data type and a short description)
- any authorization headers that are required

For example, if you are using an endpoint to create a new Plan, you might need to pass the Plans's initial price, renewal price, and some important metadata as parameters.
Once you've set the parameters you want to test, you can click "Try It" button on the page, and the request will be run live in your browser.
This allows you to enter the parameters and see the response in your browser, and if needed, troubleshoot from a clean environment.
Once you are satisfied with the request you've created, you can use the code generated by our API reference to integrate the API into your app.
