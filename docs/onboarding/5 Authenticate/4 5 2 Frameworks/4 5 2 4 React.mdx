import QuickstartCard from "../../../../src/components/QuickstartCard";

Assuming you've setup your backend with one of our Auth plugins, you can add support for wallet login to your React frontends. We'll go over the necessary setup below.

<div className="row" style={{ marginTop: 24 }}>
  <div className="col col--12">
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Example Repo: React + Auth"
      link="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/thirdweb-auth-next"
      description="Implement thirdweb Auth with React"
      image="/assets/languages/javascript.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Installation

First, we need to install the `@thirdweb-dev/react` package as follows:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react ethers
```

Now, we'll need to wrap the top-level of our app with the `ThirdwebProvider` and provide some configuration for Auth:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider
      desiredChainId={1}
      authConfig={{
        // Set this to your domain to prevent signature malleability attacks.
        domain: "example.com",
        authUrl: "/api/auth",
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

Here, we specify in the `authConfig` that our Auth backend is setup at the `/api/auth` URL, and that the domain we expect (which must match the domain we selected on the backend) is `example.com` (you would replace this with your own domain).

### Login Button

Now, we can use the `ConnectWallet` button to enable a simple login flow for our users:

```jsx
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  return <ConnectWallet />;
};

export default Home;
```

This button will allow user to connect their wallet via MetaMask, WalletConnect, and CoinbaseWallet, and then login to the backend with Auth.

### Hooks

Alternatively, we can use the `useLogin`, `useUser`, and `useLogout` hooks to enable Auth functionality in the rest of our app.

For example, I can create the following component to allow users to login, logout, and view their address:

```jsx
import {
  useAddress,
  useUser,
  useLogin,
  useLogout,
  useMetamask,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
  const address = useAddress();
  const connect = useMetamask();

  const login = useLogin();
  const logout = useLogout();
  const { user } = useUser();

  return (
    <div>
      {address ? (
        <>
          <button onClick={() => login()}>Login with Wallet</button>
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
          <pre>User: {JSON.stringify(user || null)}</pre>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

Here, we use the `useLogin`, `useUser`, and `useLogout` to enable a secure wallet based login flow for users on our frontend.
