# Integrate via Webhooks

Webhooks are a way for an application to provide real-time notifications to other systems when certain events occur. They allow you to build integrations that respond to specific events in a more efficient and scalable way than constantly polling an API for updates.

To integrate with webhooks, you will need to set up an endpoint on your own server that will receive the webhook notifications. You will then configure your webhooks to send notifications to this endpoint, and implement handling for the webhook notifications on your server.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up and implement an integration with webhooks, including how to set up a webhook endpoint, configure your webhooks, and handle webhook notifications. We will also provide examples of how this can be done in JavaScript

If you aren't familiar, [Webhooks](https://hookdeck.com/webhooks/guides/what-are-webhooks-how-they-work#what-is-a-webhook) are a widely popular form of communication between web servers. Instead of having to constantly refetch data from an API, your server will be sent updates (aka webhooks) whenever an event happens on the providers end.

### What kind of Webhooks do we send?

We send webhooks when key events happen for your company and users. These events are useful for knowing when a User has purchased your product and when they should be granted access to your software. We also send an event when the User should no longer have access.

Thus, your application is simply responsible for accepting incoming requests from Whop and processing them as you see fit.

### Configure your Webhook URL

The Whop Business dashboard has a dedicated [developer settings page](https://dash.whop.com/developer), where you'll be able to access, update, and manage all things related to Whop API. This is where you'll begin configuring your webhook endpoint URL.

### Test your Endpoint

Enter your correct route into the modal and click the **Send test webhook** button. Our server will attempt to `POST` an example webhook event to the endpoint your provided. If your application accepts the request and returns a 200 HTTP response code, you'll see a green message saying "Test successful". Now, your endpoint will begin receiving events.

Here is an abbreviated example of the payload that would have been sent to your server:

```
{
  "action": "membership.went_valid",
  "data": {
    "id": "mem_DWWmfqMNSk5TVF",
    "created_at": "2022-12-05 02:28:57 +0200",
    "access_pass": {
        ...
    },
    "user": {
        ...
    },
    "plan": {
        ...
    },
    "status": "active",
    "license_key": "DEMO-508ED6-8D5E4B16-2A409FW",
    "metadata": {},
    "valid": true,
    "quantity": 1,
    "renewal_period_start": "2022-12-05 02:28:57 +0200",
    "renewal_period_end": "2023-01-04 02:28:57 +0200",
    "wallet_address": null,
    "custom_fields_responses": {},
    "discord": null,
    "email": "email603180@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

### Handling Events

Here is an example of how you could handle this webhook notification in JavaScript:

```js
function handleMembershipWebhook(payload) {
  // Extract the relevant information from the payload
  const membershipId = payload.data.id;
  const status = payload.data.status;
  const user = payload.data.user;
  const plan = payload.data.plan;
  const valid = payload.data.valid;

  // Do something with the extracted information, such as updating a database or sending an email
  updateMembershipInDatabase(membershipId, status, user, plan, valid);
}
```

Here is an example of how you could handle this webhook notification in Ruby:

```python
def handle_membership_webhook(payload)
  # Extract the relevant information from the payload
  membership_id = payload['data']['id']
  status = payload['data']['status']
  user = payload['data']['user']
  plan = payload['data']['plan']
  valid = payload['data']['valid']

  # Do something with the extracted information, such as updating a database or sending an email
  update_membership_in_database(membership_id, status, user, plan, valid)
end
```

Once you start receiving events, the next step is to make use of them so that you can deliver access of your product to the User who just purchased. Here is an example database you can build:

- Make a `Users` table
  - Store the `user.id` and the `user.email` from the event payload
- Make a `Subscriptions` table
  - Store the `Membership` `id` from the event payload
  - Store the `valid` boolean from the event payload
  - Attach it to the user you just made

For a complete guide on the specific events we send, as well as some other technical details, visit the [Webhooks page](/webhooks/).

### Post purchase experience

On the [passes page](https://dash.whop.com/passes/), you'll want to configure your post purchase welcome message to include instructions on how your buyer can claim their account and/or access your application. It might be helpful to include a link to your login or FAQ.

### Test your Integration

Once your business logic is ready, you'll want to test your integration to make sure events are handled properly and your users will experience the desired flow. Using the free `Plan` you made earlier, you can purchase a free `Membership` to your company, and wait for the `membership.went_valid` to be sent to your server. Similarly, if you want to test the `membership.went_invalid` event, you can terminate the free `Membership` you just purchased by navigating to the [members](https://dash.whop.com/members) page and opening your `User`'s profile.

### Continue setup

Now that your developer integration is ready, you'll want to continue configuring your dashboard by setting up your `AccessPasses`, `Plans`, and `Experiences` before you launch. Click [here](/getting-started/sell-access#finish-setup) to continue our step-by-step guide.
