# Integrate via Oauth

OAuth is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party access to their resources without sharing their passwords. It is often used to allow users to securely authenticate with applications and authorize access to their data.

In this integration scenario, you can use OAuth to authenticate your users and then check whether they have an active membership. This can be useful if you want to build membership functionality into your application and need a way to confirm that users hold a valid membership.

To implement this integration, you will need to set up OAuth authentication for your application and then make API requests to check the status of a user's membership. You can use the information returned from these requests to determine whether a user has an active membership and take any necessary actions based on that information.

### Prerequisites

To start the integration process, you'll need to find a way to authenticate users and verify they have access to your product.
To implement OAuth2 through Whop, you will need to head to your [developer settings page](https://dash.whop.com/developer) to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret.
These keys will be used to identify your website/app and authenticate it to the Whop API.
In order to complete the OAuth setup process, you must also specify a redirect URL.
This URL should be an endpoint on your website that is specifically designed to receive responses from the service.
Once you receive a response, you can use the user's access tokens to grant them access to the requested resources.

### Implementing Whop Oauth

Here is an example of how you could implement OAuth2 authentication and membership verification in JavaScript using the Whop API:

1. Obtain your OAuth keys and set up your redirect URL: Follow the instructions provided in your developer settings to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret, and specify a redirect URL on your website.

2. Direct users to the login page: When a user tries to access a protected resource on your website, redirect them to the login page. This page should contain a button where users can begin your Oauth flow.

3. Exchange the authorization code for an access token: When a user returns from your Oauth flow they will return with a `code` parameter in the URL, your server should make a request to the Whop API to exchange the authorization code for an access token. This request should include your Client ID and Client Secret, as well as the authorization code and redirect URL.

4. Use the access token to make API requests: Once you have received an access token, you can use it to make API requests on behalf of the user. For example, you could make a request to the `/me` endpoint to retrieve the user's profile information, or a request to the `/memberships` endpoint to check the status of the user's membership.

### Implementing Whop OAuth (more specific example)

First, you will need to send your users to the Whop OAuth Portal. You can do this by having the user click a login button, which might look something like this:

```
<a href={`https://whop.com/oauth?client_id=${process.env.CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${process.env.REDIRECT_URI}`}>
    <button>Login with Whop</button>
</a>
```

After being redirected, the user will be prompted to sign in with their existing Whop account (or to create a new one)

Once the user has authenticated themselves on the Whop OAuth Portal, they will be redirected back to the redirect_uri specified. This link will look something like this:

```
https://your_redirect_uri.com/auth/whop/callback?code=RANDOM_AUTH_CODE
```

Once you have this code, you will need to make a `POST` request to Whop, in order to exchange this code for a full authorization token.

```
let response = await fetch("https://data.whop.com/oauth/token", {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      code: RANDOM_AUTH_CODE,
      client_id: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
      redirect_uri: process.env.REDIRECT_URI,
      grant_type: "authorization_code"
    })
}

let parsed_response = response.json()
let access_token = parsed_response.access_token
```

And now your user is authenticated! You can store this access token as a cookie or store it elsewhere, and use to make requests client-side (using this access token in the Authorization header of your requests).

### Gating Access to your Software/App

Now that your OAuth implementation is working and users are authenticated, check if a user holds a pass using the `/me/has_access/:id` endpoint. You can find the documentation for this endpoint [here](https://dev.whop.com/reference/has_access).

- Checking for access on a **Company** level (by passing a `biz_*************` ID) will tell you if a user has any valid memberships under the specified company.
- Checking for access on an **Access Pass** level (by passing a `pass_*************` ID) will tell you if a user has any valid memberships under the specified access pass.
- Checking for access on an **Experience** level (by passing an `exp_*************` ID) will tell you if a user has any valid memberships that give access to the specified experience.

Customize the user's experience on your app by pulling in their profile using the various `/me` endpoints and displaying that info on your app. This can include their username, social accounts, profile picture, and other details.

For example, every time a user accesses your app, you might want to retrieve their personalization info from the [Retrieve Profile](https://dev.whop.com/reference/retrieve_profile) endpoint.
Then, check if they still have access to your app (by checking if they hold your **Access Pass** using the [Has Access](https://dev.whop.com/reference/has_access) endpoint).
Now you know the identity of the user, as well as their access level, and can conditionally show them your software/app.
