# Webhooks

Our webhooks provide powerful integration for your webapp with minimal effort on your end. We offer webhooks for key parts of the user journey, including membership validation and payment success/failure.

## Setup Instructions

Checkout this guide to setup webhooks for your app: [Quick Integration Guide](/getting-started/quick-integration)

## FAQ

1. What is a webhook?
  - A webhook is a way for Whop to send your application information about your users and their membership status. You can use this information to update your own database or integration accordingly.

2. Are all events sent to the same endpoint?
  - Yes, all events are sent to the endpoint you configure in your [developer settings](https://dash.whop.com/developer). However, you can distinguish between events by looking at the `event` field in the payload on the root level of the object.

3. How quickly are events sent?
  - Webhooks events are sent as soon as the action takes place on our platform. You should expect a delay of no longer than a **few seconds**. 

4. What if my endpoint goes offline?
  - We will continue to attempt to send events to your specified URL. Once your endpoint's functionality restores, you'll begin receiving and processing events like normal.

## Event Types

Below is the list of all of the different event types you can / will receive to your endpoint.

All Whop API webhooks events follow a similar format. The root level of the object will always have an `event` key-value pair, and a `data` key-value pair. Event will describe the type of event being received by your server, and `data` will contain the resource related to the request.

Membership events will have a `data` object that is one-to-one with the [Membership object](https://dev.whop.com/reference/retrieve_membership) from the Whop API V2, with the AccessPass and Plan expanded.

Payment events will have a `data` object that is one-to-one with the [Payment object](https://dev.whop.com/reference/retrieve_payment) from the Whop API V2, with the AccessPass and Plan expanded.
