# Webhooks

Our webhooks provide powerful integration for your webapp with minimal effort on your end. We offer webhooks for key parts of the user journey, including membership validation and payment success/failure.

## Setup Instructions

To set up your webhook-listener URL, go to your dashboard and input it in the webhooks section. You can then send a test webhook to ensure it's working properly.

## List of webhooks 

### Membership goes valid
  - This webhook will fire when a membership becomes valid, typically when a membership is created or a user checks out. 

  - Example:
   ```
      xxx
    ```

### Membership goes invalid
  - This webhook will fire when a membership becomes invalid, typically when a subscription is canceled or the membership expires.

  - Example:
    ```
      xxx
    ```
### Payment successful
  - This webhook will fire when a payment is successful, for both new and existing memberships.

  - Example:
  ```
    xxx
  ```

### Payment attempt failed
  - This webhook will fire whenever a payment attempt. This will only send on **existing memberships whose status is ALWAYS past_due**. 
  - Example:
  ```
    xxx
  ```
