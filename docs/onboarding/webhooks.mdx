# Webhooks

Our webhooks provide powerful integration for your webapp with minimal effort on your end. We offer webhooks for key parts of the user journey, including membership validation and payment success/failure.

## Setup Instructions

Checkout this guide to setup webhooks for your app: [Quick Integration Guide](/getting-started/quick-integration)

## FAQ

1. What is a webhook?
  - A webhook is a way for Whop to send your application information about your users and their membership status. You can use this information to update your own database or integration accordingly.

2. Why use webhooks?
  - Instead of having to spend time integrating multiple API calls, endpoints, and data fetches, webhooks simplify the integration process by facilitating all communication between your application and Whop through a single channel.
  Additionally, you won't have to worry about rate limits.

2. Are all events sent to the same endpoint?
  - Yes, all events are sent to the endpoint you configure in your [developer settings](https://dash.whop.com/developer). However, you can distinguish between events by looking at the `event` field in the payload on the root level of the object.

3. How quickly are events sent?
  - Webhooks events are sent as soon as the action takes place on our platform. You should expect a delay of no longer than a **few seconds**. 

4. What if my endpoint goes offline?
  - We will continue to attempt to send events to your specified URL. Once your endpoint's functionality restores, you'll begin receiving and processing events like normal.

## Event Types

Whop currently sends the following events: `membership.went_valid`, `membership.went_invalid`, `payment.succeeded`, and `payment.failed`

All Whop API webhooks events follow a similar format. The root level of the object will always have an `event` key, and a `data` key. Event will be a string describing the type of event being received by your server, and `data` will be an object containing the resource related to the request.

Membership events will have a `data` object that is one-to-one with the [Membership object](https://dev.whop.com/reference/retrieve_membership) from the Whop API V2, with the `AccessPass`, `Plan`, and `User` expanded.

Payment events will have a `data` object that is one-to-one with the [Payment object](https://dev.whop.com/reference/retrieve_payment) from the Whop API V2, with the `AccessPass`, `Plan`, and `User` expanded.

### Membership goes valid
  - This webhook will fire when a membership becomes valid, typically when a membership is created or a user checks out.
  - **Business Logic Example:** Mark a `User`'s subscription as `valid`, which allows them to access a gated section of my app.
  - **Event name:** `membership.went_valid`
  - **Important Attributes:** `id`, `valid`, `status`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`

  - **Example Payload:**

### Membership goes invalid
  - This webhook will fire when a membership becomes invalid, typically when a subscription is canceled or the membership expires.
  - **Business Logic Example:** Mark a `User`'s subscription as `invalid`, which blocks them from accessing a gated section of my app.
  - **Event name:** `membership.went_invalid`
  - **Important Attributes:** `id`, `valid`, `status`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`

  - **Example Payload:**
```

  }
}
```

### Payment attempt failed
  - This webhook will fire whenever a payment attempt fails. This is usually due to a card having insufficient funds, or a crypto payment not having a proper allowance or balance.
  - **Business Logic Example:** Record the failed payment attempt so that you can remind the user with an overlay inside of your app to have them update their payment method.
  - **Event name:** `payment.failed`
  - **Important Attributes:** `id`, `membership`, `status`, `final_amount`, `user.id`, `access_pass.id`

  - **Example Payload:**
