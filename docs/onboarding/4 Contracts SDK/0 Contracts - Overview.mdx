# Extensions

Build smart contracts with Solidity and unlock the features of the [dashboard](/dashboard) and [SDK](/sdk), with:

- **Base Contracts** that you can build upon, such as [ERC721Base](/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base).
- **Features** for you to implement, such as [Permission Controls](/contractkit/permissions) and [Royalty Fees](/contractkit/royalty).

To get started, run the below command to create a new project with your preferences set up:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --contract
```

Or install the `contracts` package into your existing Solidity project:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```

## Why Use Extensions?

Each feature you implement in your smart contracts unlocks functionality in both the dashboard and SDK to help you build applications on top of them.

For example, if you implement the [ERC721Base](/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base) contract, you'll unlock the `mint` button in the dashboard and
can use the [mint](/pre-built-contracts/nft-collection#using-the-thirdweb-sdk-1) function in the SDK; which automatically uploads and pins your metadata to IPFS!

## How It Works

You can think of extensions as building blocks that help you enrich your smart contracts with features.

Some blocks come packaged together as **Base Contracts**, which come with a full set of features out of the box that you can modify and extend.
Other (smaller) blocks are **Features**, which provide a way for you to pick and choose which individual pieces you want to put into your contract;
with full customization of how those features work.

With both base contracts and features, you can add and customize functionality by creating a contract
that inherits the logic of the contract(s) you want to use and add any of your custom logic.
