## Unlocked Features

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these contracts on the SDK and dashboard:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ marginTop: 16 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Platform Fee"
      link="/sdk/advanced-features/contract-settings#platform-fees"
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Implementing the Contract extension

Import the contract extension and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PlatformFee.sol";

contract MyContract is PlatformFee {
    /**
     *  We store the contract deployer's address only for the purposes of the example
     *  in the code comment below.
     *
     *  Doing this is not necessary to use the `PlatformFee` extension.
     */
    address public deployer;

    constructor() {
        deployer = msg.sender;
    }

    /**
     *  This function returns who is authorized to set platform fee info for your contract.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we'll only allow the contract deployer to set the platform fee info.
     *
     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `PlatformFee` extension.
     */
    function _canSetPlatformFeeInfo() internal virtual override returns (bool) {
        return msg.sender == deployer;
    }
}
```
