# Permissions

Add permissions to your smart contract to control which addresses can perform certain actions.

There are two different contracts you can implement to add permissions:

- `Permissions`: Create roles and restrict access to functions based on those roles.
- `PermissionsEnumerable`: `Permissions` plus the capability to view all the addresses holding a specific role (or all roles).

You only need to implement **one** of the two.

## Unlocked Features

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these contracts on the SDK and dashboard:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Permission Controls"
      link="/sdk/advanced-features/permission-controls"
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Permissions Contract

<ViewContractCodeButton
  link="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol"
  name="Permissions"
/>

### Implementing the Feature

Import the contract and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyContract is Permissions {
    // Any `bytes32` value is a valid role. You can create roles by defining them like this.
    bytes32 public constant NUMBER_ROLE = keccak256("NUMBER_ROLE");

    // See comments for `setNumber`, below.
    uint256 public number;

    /**
     *  The `Permissions` contract makes an already defined role available: the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we grant the deployer of the contract this admin role.
     */
    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
     *  EXAMPLE: here we have a function that we want to restrict only to holders of `NUMBER_ROLE`.
     *
     *  To accomplish this, we use the `onlyRole` modifier made available by `Permissions`, and
     *  pass it `NUMBER_ROLE` as an argument.
     */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public onlyRole(NUMBER_ROLE) {
        number = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## Permissions Enumerable Contract

The `PermissionsEnumberable` is built upon the `Permissions` feature,
and exposes convenient methods to fetch all wallets that hold a given role.

```solidity

import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PermissionsEnumerable.sol";

// Usage is the same as `extensions/Permissions.sol`

contract MyContract is PermissionsEnumerable {
    // Any `bytes32` value is a valid role. You can create roles by defining them like this.
    bytes32 public constant NUMBER_ROLE = keccak256("NUMBER_ROLE");

    // See comments for `setNumber`, below.
    uint256 public number;

    /**
     *  The `Permissions` contract makes an already defined role available: the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public onlyRole(NUMBER_ROLE) {
        number = _newNumber;
    }
}
