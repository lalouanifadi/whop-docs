The SDK makes it easy to deploy new Solana programs with just a few lines of code.

More specifically, you can deploy any of the following programs programmatically:

- [NFT Collection](https://portal.thirdweb.com/programs/nft-collections)
- [Token](https://portal.thirdweb.com/programs/tokens)
- [NFT Drop](https://portal.thirdweb.com/programs/nft-drops)

Let's take a look at how we can do this!

### Deploying an NFT Collection

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Deployer"}
  name={"createNftCollection"}
  isSolana
/>

### Deploying a Token

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Deployer"} name={"createToken"} isSolana />

### Deploying an NFT Drop

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Deployer"} name={"createNftDrop"} isSolana />
