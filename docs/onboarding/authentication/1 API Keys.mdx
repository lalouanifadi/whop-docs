## Using the Whop API

To make requests to the Whop API, you are required to an authentication header, which will contain your API key. It should look like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```

It's important to keep your API keys safe and secure. Do not share them with anyone. You should also regularly check the business dashboard in the settings to make sure that only active keys are being used.

If you need to generate additional API keys for your company, you can do so from the business dashboard in the settings. You can also remove any unused or compromised keys from this same location.

By using your API keys, you can access all of the endpoints and features provided by our API on behalf of your company. This allows you to integrate our API into your own applications and services, and to take full advantage of all of the functionality that it offers.
