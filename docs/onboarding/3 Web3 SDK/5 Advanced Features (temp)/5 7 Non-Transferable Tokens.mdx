# Non-Transferable Tokens

Configure tokens in your smart contract to be non-transferable (or "soulbound").

For a step-by-step tutorial, check our [Make your NFT non-transferable](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/make-your-nft-non-transferable) guide.

To make tokens in your contract non-transferable, set the [transfer role](/sdk/advanced-features/permission-controls) to be empty.

```javascript
const rolesAndMembers = await contract.roles.getAll();

const updatedRoles = {
  ...rolesAndMembers,
  transfer: [],
};

await contract.roles.setAll(updatedRoles);
```
