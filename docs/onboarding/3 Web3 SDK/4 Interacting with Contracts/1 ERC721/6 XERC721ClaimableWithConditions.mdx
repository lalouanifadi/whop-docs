# ERC721 - Claim Conditions

ERC721Claimable is an extension of [ERC721Claimable](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721claimable) that enables claim conditions.

You can utilize these features of the SDK on your contract if it implements [ERC721ClaimableWithConditions](/contractkit/erc721claimable).

## Configure claim conditions

Define the criteria of how NFTs can be claimed from your drop.

Each claim phase can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs to drop
- How much to charge per NFT
- What currency to use to sell the NFTs
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds do wallets have to wait between claims
