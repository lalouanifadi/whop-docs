# Getting a Contract

Connect to your smart contract using its contract address.

## Connect to a contract

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"ThirdwebSDK"}
  name={"getContract"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>

## Get Contract From ABI

If you have compiled your Solidity code into an [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#contract-abi-specification),
you can use it to connect to your contract.

This is useful if you want to interact with a contract that was **not** deployed using thirdweb.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"ThirdwebSDK"}
  name={"getContractFromAbi"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>
