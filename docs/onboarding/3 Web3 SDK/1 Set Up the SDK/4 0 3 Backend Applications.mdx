# Backend & Scripting Applications

Back-end applications are suitable for when you need to perform actions from _**your**_ wallet or simply need to **read** data,
rather than connecting to your user's wallets.

You can build back-end applications or scripts by using any of our SDKs:

- [TypeScript](/typescript)
- [Python](/python)
- [Go](/go)

There are multiple different ways you can instantiate the SDK and use it, that vary depending on what you need to do.

## From a Private key

This instantiates the SDK with write-permissions directly from a wallet's private key.

If you expose your private key, anyone can access your wallet's funds. Please proceed carefully.

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- Check if you need to use a private key for your application.
- **Never** directly expose your private key in your source code.
- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.
- **Never** use a private key for a frontend (website/dapp) application.

If you are unsure how to securely store and access your private key, please do not proceed.

## From a Signer / Provider

You can use a signer such as one from an
[Ethers Web3Provider](https://docs.ethers.io/v4/cookbook-providers.html) to instantiate the SDK.
