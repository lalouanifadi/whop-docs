# Building Frontend Applications

You can build front-end applications by using our [React](/react) and [TypeScript](/typescript) SDKs!

Front-end applications are best-suited when you want users to connect their wallets to your web application and interact with your contracts using their wallet; such as an [NFT Minting Website](/templates/nft-drop).

## Automatic Set Up

The easiest way to get started is by using the [thirdweb CLI](/cli).

This interactive tool creates a new project with thirdweb pre-configured with a framework and language of your choice.

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

That's it! You're project is ready to start interacting with your contract!

:::tip Starter Kits & Templates

You can start with one of our [template projects](/templates) by passing the `--template` flag and the name of the example repo.

## Manual Installation

If you have an **existing** project you want to integrate thirdweb into, install the thirdweb SDKs:

```bash
npm install @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers
```

Then wrap your application in the `ThirdwebProvider` to get started!

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ChainId } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// the chainId our app wants to be running on
// for our example the Polygon Mumbai Testnet
const desiredChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```

### From a Signer / Provider

```jsx
import { ChainId, ThirdwebSDKProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mainnet;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // If you want to use any custom provider or signer, add it here.
  const myProvider = ...;
  const mySigner = ...;


  return (
    <ThirdwebSDKProvider
      desiredChainId={activeChainId}
      signer={mySigner}
      provider={myProvider}
    >
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </ThirdwebSDKProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
